# Overview of XION

## Intro

XION is the first modular Generalized Abstraction layer, purpose built for consumer adoption by enabling seamless user experiences for everyday users.



XION’s Generalized Abstraction layer includes protocol-level abstractions across Accounts, Signatures, Gas, Interoperability, Pricing, Devices, Payments, and more. By abstracting away all crypto complexities, XION allows the development of next-generation projects bringing Web3 to mainstream audiences worldwide.

## **Generalized Abstraction Layer 1 Chain**

* Generalized Abstraction: unique protocol-level abstraction that spans Accounts, Signatures, Payments, Pricing, Interoperability, Devices, Gas, and more to make Web3 accessible to everyone, everywhere.
  * Account Abstraction — XION has account abstraction (aka Meta Accounts) at the protocol level
  * Signature Abstraction — XION is the first chain to be signature-curve agnostic, enabling the signing of transactions using email, biometrics (FaceID, Passkeys, etc.), EVM curve, Solana curve, and more
  * Gas Abstraction — XION eliminates the concept of gas fees entirely for the end user
  * Pricing Abstraction — XION is the first chain to utilize familiar fiat denominated pricing, also eliminating asset volatility
  * Abstracted Interoperability — XION enables true cross-chain interoperability
  * Device Abstraction — XION provides safe and efficient operations across various devices through its Meta Accounts & signature abstraction
  * Payment Abstraction — The XION chain is token-agnostic, enabling users to transact with any token of choice as well as direct credit and debit card transactions
* XION’s infrastructure allows the development of next-generation mass-market projects through unparalleled user-friendly experiences. This is made possible by its Meta Accounts, seamless device support, lightning-fast gasless transactions, extremely low fees, native on & off ramps, global direct credit/debit card purchasing, familiar fiat denomination, interoperability with 50+ other networks, and more.
  * XION’s L1 abstracts away all crypto complexities for users to enable mass adoption
