## II. About Burnt&#x20;

The Origins of Burnt Banksy&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/burnt banksy painting (1) (1).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Burnt Founder and CEO, Burnt Banksy, made history in the NFT community with the burning of an authentic Banksy art work. In an effort to prove the concept of digital scarcity, Burnt Banksy purchased a physical copy of a Banksy painting, burned it, created an authenticated 1 of 1 NFT representation, and sold it for more than the original physical item.

### Our Mainstream Press Coverage

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Group 2 (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This act received universal acclaim and was covered by leading publications such as Bloomberg, CoinDesk, GQ, CoinTelegraph, BBC, CBS, HYPEBEAST, [Art.Net](http://art.net), TechCrunch, and many others.

### Inception: Providing Access to All

The vision has been the same from the start - making Web3 approachable to all users. _Burnt Banksy_ was a way to demonstrate the concept of digital scarcity on a world stage, and we began in 2021 by building early NFT & Collection standards, and no code products. We believed everyone, regardless of technical knowledge, should be able to have the same access to Web3 benefits.

Unfortunately, the tools we had at our disposal made it nearly impossible to build products that could reach mass, everyday audiences. The user experience was broken. For new users interacting with Web3 apps for the first time, it would take upwards of 15 complicated steps and multiple days to successfully complete a purchase. Users were forced to choose which wallet extension to download all the way to having the necessary funds to submit a transaction, resulting in drop-off rates upwards of 95%.

This led us to building XION, the first L1 blockchain intended to abstract the technical crypto barriers for all users through its unique Generalized Abstraction infrastructure. XIONâ€™s toolkit includes native account abstraction, seamless fiat on/off ramps, direct credit/debit card purchases, familiar Web2 logins, gasless transactions, familiar fiat denomination, interoperability with all ecosystems, and more to make Web3 accessible to all.

## III. Burntâ€™s Layer 1 Blockchain: XION

ðŸ”¥ **XION is the first layer one blockchain purpose-built for mass consumer adoption, with its primitive chain-level Generalized Abstraction enabling seamless experiences for everyday users.**

XION allows the development of next-generation mass-market projects with protocol level generalized abstraction including seamless email login, mobile support, lightning-fast gasless transactions, native on & off ramps, global direct credit/debit card purchasing, fiat denomination, abstracted interoperability with 50+ other networks, and more.

**Accounts: XION pioneers modular account abstraction at the protocol level.**

Traditional wallets are notorious for causing a staggering 95%+ drop-off in user onboarding. The necessity to download plugins, endure complex setups, navigate confusing pop-ups, understand and safely store seed phrases, and cope with a generally off-putting user experience are major deterrents for non-technical users. The antidote to this is account abstraction and the initiation of smart contract accounts (SCAs). Not only do they allow familiar login methods such as email for users, but they also unlock other security enhancements like account recovery, account permissioning, and much more. In addition, XIONâ€™s abstract accounts remain invisible to the rest of the protocol. This design, subtle yet impactful, ensures that developers can focus on creating value without needing to make any special considerations for these accounts.

**Signatures: Through complete Signature Abstraction, XION breaks the mold as the first chain to support signing across all cryptographic curves.**

This breakthrough means XION enables the signing of transactions using Appleâ€™s FaceID, Passkeys, JWTs, EVM curve, Solana curve, and beyond. Moreover, given XIONâ€™s modular approach, it's primed for extending support to many more signature schemes as new ones emerge, rendering XION â€˜future-proofâ€™. Also, when utilizing non-wallet authenticators like JWTs, FaceID, NFCs, ZKs, and the likes, no trusted proxies or oracles are needed since communication occurs directly against the chain. This not only heightens security but also aligns perfectly with the Web3 ethos of trustlessness.

**Interoperability: XION is truly interoperable with all ecosystems, allowing users the power to initiate cross-chain one-click checkout and staking with any token.**

Especially in an industry flush with different chains and tokens, itâ€™s pivotal for XION to be accessible to all users. Through its Abstracted Interoperability, XION taps into the liquidity of all ecosystems by enabling users from any chain and with any token to transact/stake/and ultimately operate with XION seamlessly.

**Pricing: XION is the first chain to utilize familiar fiat-denominated pricing throughout the chain, made possible by combining multiple facets of its abstraction.**

This innovation has many benefits related to security, stability, and familiarity. Given USDC is native to the ecosystem, users donâ€™t have to worry about bridging risks. In addition, fiat-denominated assets eliminate price volatility, enabling many consumer-facing use-cases not previously possible. Lastly, it enables all assets on XION to be denominated in familiar currency to everyday users.

**Gas: XION completely removes the concept of gas fees from the end userâ€™s perspective.**

Gas fees have been one of Web3â€™s biggest hurdles for new users. Besides introducing an unfamiliar concept to new users, the process of acquiring the necessary gas tokens is a major barrier to entry in most ecosystems. This turns out to be a significant barrier not just for end-users but app builders as well, as they are burdened with gas management and procurement. XION entirely eradicates this entry barrier for users by leveraging its protocol-level abstraction and built-in paymasters.

**Payments: XION streamlines payments via direct credit and debit card transactions, eradicating the traditional purchasing complexities seen in other chains, courtesy of its unique fee abstraction.**

In conventional chains, the current process of purchasing items on-chain with fiat is a herculean task, often involving 15+ steps and sometimes extending over a week to complete. A user must endure the ordeal of signing up to a centralized exchange, performing KYC, waiting for their money to transfer, dealing with wallets, bridging the funds, swapping to the correct currency, and more before making a purchase. Contrary to this, XION, with 95%+ authorization rates, instantly reaching around 6 billion credit/debit card holders, and facilitates purchases in less than 60 seconds from start to finish, offers a purchasing experience that truly mirrors that of a familiar Web2 e-commerce website.

**Devices: XION fully abstracts away the concept of wallet plugins or apps, enabling users to access their XION accounts in myriad waysâ€”whether it's by email, FaceID, Passkeys, or other methods â€” providing robust support and efficient operations across various devices.**

The ability to effortlessly support all devices, especially mobile, is the gateway to true retail adoption. A significant chunk of all digital interactions occur on mobile devices. However, the current mobile crypto wallets are a security risk, donâ€™t translate well between different devices, require users to unsafely travel with their seed phrase, and the current UI/UX of in-app browsers is incredibly under-performant. XIONâ€™s infrastructure, on the other hand, ensures ease of access to accounts from any device. Moreover, it allows the separation of login from assets, creating a safe avenue for users to interact with new apps without putting their assets at risk. In essence, it permits users to access XIONâ€™s ecosystem anytime, anywhere, safely.

## VI. BURNT Token

### **Token Use Cases**

* Proof of Stake Security (staking)
  * XION is a proof-of-stake network which means it is secured through the staking of the $BURNT tokens by validators, whose job it is to maintain the state of the chain and process the transactions. Validators are rewarded for their work, and if they misbehave, their staked tokens are slashed.
  * $BURNT holders can delegate holdings with validators or stake $BURNT to run their own validator to secure the network.
* Network Usage Fees (platform fees)
  * XION is a public ledger, and transactions are sent to the chain to alter its state. The network charges platform fees and XION uses the fees that have been collected in a block, and offsets how many new tokens need to be minted in the block. When fee accrual exceeds the number of tokens per block necessary to distribute to stakers, then the extra tokens are burnt, and the token will naturally become deflationary.
  * This means that higher usage of the network increases fees earned, which further incentivizes validators to secure the network.
* Governance (voting)
  * The token is used for voting and governance on proposals put forth by the XION DAO, a fully decentralized organization. The XION DAO will control the funds held by the XION Community Treasury and vote on any proposals to alter the network.
* Medium of Exchange
  * The $BURNT token can be used to transfer value across the Layer 1 applications and accounts in a peer to peer fashion without the need for trusted third parties to clear and settle payments.
