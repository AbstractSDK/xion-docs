# Get Started Guide

Within the ‘Get Started Guide’ section, a tour of the fundamental aspects of CosmWasm Smart Contracts is offered. Although a baseline understanding of Rust would be helpful, the content is intended for learners of all levels, regardless of their experience. The goal is to provide easy-to-follow instructions and give first-time users hands-on experience by walking them through a step-by-step guide. It has been intentionally designed to be as easy to follow as possible, avoiding the potential complications associated with the intricacies of smart contract development, which will be addressed in other sections.
