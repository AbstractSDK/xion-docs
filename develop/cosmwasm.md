### What is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform written as a module that can be integrated into any blockchain built on top of the Cosmos SDK. In simple terms, it is the Cosmos (Cosm) way of utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), hence its name.

Rust is currently the most widely used programming language for CosmWasm. In the future, other programming languages, such as Golang, may  be utilized.&#x20;
