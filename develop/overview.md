# Overview

XION, as the first chain purpose-built for consumer adoption, represents an incredible opportunity for application developers to reach consumers in a natural and familiar way. As a developer, there are a few ways to build on top of, or contribute to, the community:

### XION Layer 1

Contributing to XION's Layer 1 blockchain entails working directly with the core technology that underpins the XION blockchain protocol. You'll be enhancing fundamental aspects of the system, from optimizing the consensus protocol to ensuring the accuracy of transaction validation. With the Go programming language being the mainstay for XION, a strong proficiency in Go is a must. Given the depth of the work, you'll also need a solid understanding of blockchain technology, cryptography, and peer-to-peer networking. Opportunities for contribution here may extend to open-source code development, participating in core development discussions, and running a node on the network.

### CosmWasm Contracts

Developing CosmWasm contracts means you'll be writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the XION blockchain. Since the XION blockchain is a Cosmos-based chain with CosmWasm support, you'll be using Rust as the main language for this task. Rust's strong safety guarantees, control over system resources, and compatibility with WebAssembly (Wasm) make it a fitting choice for writing smart contracts. Proficiency in Rust and a comprehensive understanding of CosmWasm and the broader Cosmos ecosystem are helpful for success in this domain.

### DApps

When you opt to build decentralized applications, or DApps, on the XION blockchain, you are stepping into a world of applications running atop the blockchain network. This can involve creating smart contracts using Rust and the CosmWasm module, designing intuitive user interfaces, and potentially developing backend components for off-chain functionalities. As a DApp developer, you have the chance to further enrich the XION ecosystem by creating novel services or products.
