# Getting Started

Within the ‘Getting Started’ section, a tour of the fundamental aspects of CosmWasm Smart Contracts is offered. Although a baseline understanding of Rust would be helpful, the content is intended for learners of all levels, regardless of their experience. The goal is to provide easy-to-follow instructions and give first-time users hands-on experience by walking them through a step-by-step guide that covers the following following topics:

* Setting up environment
* Deploying a smart contract to the XION blockchain
* Executing smart contract functions via the CLI
* Modifying an existing contract

If a user prefers to begin their journey by gaining insight into the underlying mechanics of CosmWasm, they are free to jump directly to the Architecture section for a brief overview. Afterward, they can return to this section to continue their exploration.

Users may have noticed that developing smart contracts is not within the scope of this section.&#x20;

The Getting Started section has been intentionally designed to be as easy to follow as possible, avoiding the potential complications associated with the intricacies of smart contract development, which will be addressed in other sections.
