# Initial Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
:warning: **Disclaimer**

While setting up a rudimentary validator node is easy, running a production-grade validator node with a robust architecture and security features requires a more involved setup, which is beyond the scope of this guide.
{% endhint %}

The tasks in this section describe how to set up a Validator Node on the Xion Network.&#x20;

The Xion Network relies on CometBFT for its Network and Consensus layers, as we are leveraging Cosmos SDK `0.47.10`

Validators run full nodes, participate in consensus by broadcasting votes, commit new blocks to the blockchain, and participate in governance of the blockchain.&#x20;

Validators can cast votes on behalf of their delegators. A validator's voting power is weighted according to their total stake. The top 100 validators make up the **Active Validator Set** and are the only validators that sign blocks and receive revenue.
